    " ## Background\n",
    "***Heart disease*** is the leading cause of death for men, women, and people of most racial and ethnic groups in most of the countries in the world, even in the countries with developed medical technology such as the United States. About 659,000 people in the US die from heart disease each year, which accounts for 1 in every 4 deaths.[[1]](https://www.who.int/health-topics/cardiovascular-diseases).\n",
    "The US CDC(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) suggests maintaining low blood pressure and cholesterol to lower the risk of heart disease [[2]](https://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/prevention.htm).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Question\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Do people with low blood pressure/cholesterol level have lower chance of developing heart disease?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "- The dataset is an actual medical records from the Cleveland Clinic Foundation stored in the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease).\n",
    "- Each observation contains 14 attributes of **a person's medical information** including the presence of heart disease.\n",
    "- The response variable is the attribute \"Class\".\n",
    "- The explanatory variables are the attribute \"trestpbs\"(blood pressure), and \"chol\"(cholesterol).\n",
    "- The detailed descriptions of the response variable and the two explanatory variables are:\n",
    "    1. *class*: presence of heart disease. integer valued from 0 (no presence) to 4\n",
    "    2. trestbps: resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)\n",
    "    3. chol: serum cholestoral in mg/dl\n",
